ShortUtils is a small library of convenient utility functions that I often use in my plugins.

## Usage
If you are a server operator, download ShortUtils [here](https://github.com/Rausy/short-utils/releases). It does not do anything on its own, it simply allows other plugins to function.

If you are a developer, you can read a tutorial [here](https://github.com/Rausy/short-utils/wiki) on how to use it.
